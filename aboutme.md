My name is **Dominik Podlipniak**, I'm 18 years old and I'm aspiring **Deep Learning Researcher**.

I live in **Szczecin, Poland**. My biggest inspirations are Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, 
Andrej Karpathy and Geoffrey E. Hinton. I'm looking forward to learn something new ! In the future
I dream to do _PhD in Artificial Intelligence abroad, preferably UK, at University of Edinburgh. I'm very **kind** and **open minded
person** and I would love to find some people as passionate about field as me so we can talk
about new ideas and learn together !
