My name is Dominik Podlipniak, I'm 18 years old and I'm aspiring Deep Learning Researcher.
I live in Szczecin, Poland. My biggest inspirations are Yann LeCun, Yoshua Bengio, 
Andrej Karpathy and Geoffrey E. Hinton. I'm looking forward to learn something new ! In the future
I want to do PhD in Artificial Intelligence abroad, preferably UK. I'm very kind and open minded
person and I would love to find some people as passionate about field as me so we can talk
about new ideas and learn together !
